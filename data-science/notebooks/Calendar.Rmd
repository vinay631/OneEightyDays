I will be following tutorial from flowing data to generate "Calendar Heatmaps" for daily percent change in AAPL stock since 1981. I downloaded the dataset for this visualization from [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/help/api)

```{r}
df <- read.csv('data/WIKI-AAPL.csv', header = T)
```

First few rows of the data look like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(df)
```

Now we are going to calculate the daily percentage changes in the stock price. We will use the opening and closing price of the stock to calculate this.

```{r}
df['Change_pct'] <- abs(df['Open'] - df['Close'])/df['Close']

head(df)
```
